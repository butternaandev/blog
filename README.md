# Butternaan's Jugaad Blog

This blog uses [Zola](https://getzola.org/), a fast static site generator built in Rust. I have plans to try making an SSG, but bloody hell Zola is fast.

The theme I've used is inspired from [zerm](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm), a minimalist theme for Zola. I didn't require half the features it has (KaTeX and stuff), so I've inherited the code with some personalized changes.

These blog posts portray my perspective on... things and stuff. They're naturally going to be opinionated. If according to you, my POV is incorrect, you can either:

1. Deal with it.
2. Contact me for a healthy discussion. I'll reply if I can.
