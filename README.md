## [Abhigyan Trips' Website](https://abhigyantrips.is-a.dev/)
---
Hello! https://abhigyantrips.is-a.dev/ is my portfolio website for the time being - I plan on getting a domain soon™, and this is a test to see:
1. If can handle making a website from scratch, and maintain it. (this comes down to my laziness)
2. Whether I *need* a website in the first place - this might be more intuitive than a `resume.pdf`, but I believe a LinkedIn profile should suffice.
3. To experiment with my ability to code in HTML and CSS - since I plan on becomeing a dev, handling the website from scratch will also test my knowledge in coding.

Since you've made it this far, I'd like to thank the peeps over at [Mashup Template](http://www.mashup-template.com/)/[Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/) for their epic CSS templates. I've left a [`components.html`](./components.html) file in the repo, where you can have a look at all the available elements in the template.

There's also a moving background function - `movingBackgroundImage()` - in the [JS Script](./main.70a66962.js), if you'd like to use it.

See ya!
