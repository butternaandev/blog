# Butternaan's Jugaad Blog

This blog uses [Zola](https://getzola.org/), a fast static site generator built in Rust. I have plans to try making an SSG, but bloody hell Zola is fast.

The theme I've used is inspired from [zerm](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm), a minimalist theme for Zola. I didn't require half the features it has (KaTeX and stuff), so I've inherited the code with some personalized changes.
